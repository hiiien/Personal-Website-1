                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>As stated before I am currently a college student at the University of Alabama.
                    I love learning of any form and love finding out about new and interesting subjects/topics.
                    Of course this includes coding but is not limited to CS or even techknowledgy related topics.
                    I'm always with my friends whether we're studying at a cafe or doing some activity.
                    As of last summer, as a result of my friends' influence I have become a volleyball fanatic playing any chance I can get. 
                    Unfortunately I can only play alot during the summer but because of that I play nearly every day.
                    I can't tell yuo everything about me but if you would like to hear more please contact me through the <span class="emphasis">Contact Info</span> page.

                <h3>Pong Classic</h3>
                <p>I remade a classic version of pong using a combination of C++ and the SFML 
                    library. It allows games to 11 between two players on the same computer and once 11 points is 
                    reached a win screen pops up with which player won. It was my first attempt at a personal project
                    done entirely by myself and turned out well allowing for fully playable pong games. From working on it 
                    I gained some understanding of the SFML Library and game design processes while simultaneously developing my C++ skills and
                    fundamentals. Github:<a href="https://github.com/hiiien/Pong-Project">Pong Project</a>

                <h4>A blast from the past</h4>
                <p>While not impressive by any means its important to me as it was 
                    my first foray into any type of website development. Projects like this remind 
                me of how far I have come and give me the confidence that I can keep getting better
                despite any challenges I might face.</p>
